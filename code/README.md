# Project Name

Project two, making a chatbot.

## The problem

I tried to approach this project in several different ways, with no success. On Friday night (two days before deadline) scrapped everything I had done and started fresh. One of my team mates gave me the tip to copy the code from the example bot and play around with that to try to understand things, and that's when things finally started to make sense. I removed all the code that I couldn't understand and started making the remainder my own.
If I had more time I would have made a longer conversation between the bot and the user and also found out how to bring the conversation to a close within the chat.
